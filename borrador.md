***The IDEA project at a glance***

*The IDEA project is a two-year research project starting in 2018 and funding by a [Clarín-COFUND](http://www.clarinasturias.es/?lang=en) postdoctoral fellowship (Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions 7th FW) and the project..... The main aim of the project is to study the physical processes that occur at microscale in crystalline aggregates during deformation and strain localization in the plastic field (but also annealing). For this, we track the evolution of microstructure, texture and strain field during deformation via see-through deformation experiments using several cutting-edge techniques (high-resolution SEM-EBSD and the digital image correlation method). The research team is located at the Université de Montpellier (France) and is formed by Marco A. Lopez-Sanchez, Andrea Tommasi, David Mainprice and Fabrice Barou.*

# Why the IDEA project?

Understanding how plate tectonics works remains a cornerstone of modern geology. Deformation on the lithosphere, the "rigid" outer layer of the Earth, often occurs in a localized fashion. Excepting for the first 10 km of the Earth crust, where brittle deformation within faults predominates, the lithosphere deforms essentially through high-temperature plastic processes. This mode of deformation typically involves dislocation creep processes, with common development of planar zones of intense deformation known as shear zones. Understanding when and how strain localization occurs at different depths in the lithosphere is key to explain how plate boundaries and major faults form and evolve over time, and ultimately how plate tectonics works. Yet, strain localization remains poorly understood.

The study of strain localization in polycrystalline aggregates that deforms in the plastic field is also a subject of intense research across different scientific disciplines due to its broad interest. For example in materials science ...



# Methods & Materials



Geosciences Montpellier is **one of the two centres in the world** that own a CrystalProbe SEM specifically designed for hosting in-situ experiments

The association of these two techniques is the **main innovation of the IDEA project** since it will allow us to relate directly an independent measure of strain localization together with the microstructural and textural evolution.
