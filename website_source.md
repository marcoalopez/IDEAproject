## The IDEA project at a glance

_The IDEA project stands for **I**n-situ **D**eformation **E**xperiments to study microstructure and texture evolution in **A**nisotropic crystalline materials. This is a research project attached to a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie “Clarín”-COFUND Action](http://www.clarinasturias.es/?lang=en) postdoctoral fellowship starting in 2018 and funded by different sources including European and French research projects. The main goal of the project is to rationalize the physical processes that occur at the microscale during crystal-plastic deformation and heating. Specifically, we are interested in how recrystallization (dynamic and static) affect the properties of polycrystalline materials such as strain hardening/weakening, crystallographic orientation or strain localization. Our approach involves tracking the evolution of microstructure, CPO, and strain field during recrystallization using in situ observations. We use two main techniques: electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and digital image correlation (DIC). The core team is based at Géosciences Montpellier (Université de Montpellier - CNRS) in France and consist of [Andréa Tommasi](http://www.gm.univ-montp2.fr/PERSO/tommasi/deia-us.html) (supervisor), [Marco A. Lopez-Sanchez](https://marcoalopez.github.io/) (the recipient of the Clarín-COFUND fellowship), and Fabrice Barou (Geosciences Montpellier). We also collaborate with [David Mainprice](http://www.gm.univ-montp2.fr/PERSO/mainprice/) (GM Montpellier), [Maurine Montagnat](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/pages-personnelles/maurine-montagnat-rentier/) (IGE - Grenoble) and Romain Quey (Mines Saint-Etienne)._

## 1. Why the IDEA project?

Understanding how plate tectonics works remains a cornerstone of modern geology. Deformation on the lithosphere, the "rigid" outer layer of the Earth, mainly occurs in a localized fashion. Excepting for the first ~10 km where deformation occurs primarily through brittle faults, most of the lithosphere (~95 % in volume) deforms essentially through crystal-plastic processes. This mode of deformation typically involves the development of planar zones of intense deformation known as shear zones and dislocation creep processes. Understanding how strain localises and preserves at different depths is key to explain how plate boundaries and major faults form and evolve, and ultimately how plate tectonics works. Yet, fundamental rock behaviour (strength) and the causes of strain localization remain poorly understood.

Rationalize the mechanical response to forces at great depths (i.e. within the plastic field) is a challenge for several reasons:

- Earth scientists do not have direct access (i.e. by drilling) to rocks deforming in the plastic field, usually involving rocks deeper than 10-15 km.
- Rock deformation experiments at high _P_ and _T_ are challenging to conduct and always occur at strain rates many orders of magnitude faster (<<10^-7^ s^-1^) than in nature (10^-13^-10^-16^ s^-1^). The latter also implies that we need to use higher stresses or temperatures than those operating at specific depths in the lithosphere. As a result, flow laws estimated in the laboratory have to be scaled up by many orders of magnitude with no guarantee that the parameters obtained are correct. It is therefore necessary to understand the basic principles of plastic deformation to validate them.
- Rock behaviour during ductile deformation depends on many intrinsic (materials) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, including temperature, water fugacity, crystallographic preferred orientation, dislocation content, or grain size. In turn, these factors vary during the deformation and heating that shape the planet Earth and may show a strong degree of interdependence between them, making it difficult to separate their effects.

Here, we are particularly interested in the study of **recrystallization (RX) processes**, either during the application of differential stresses (dynamic RX) or under hydrostatic conditions (static RX), as both processes are very common in nature. Recrystallization processes affect three key parameters controlling rock strength: dislocation content, grain boundary area per unit volume (by locally decreasing or increasing the grain size), and CPO. The study of recrystallization is also a subject of intense research across different scientific disciplines due to its broad interest. For example, recrystallization processes are of great industrial importance in the processing of metallic alloys as they control the mechanical properties and behaviour of a material.

## 2. Methods & Materials

### 2.1 Equipment used

The _in situ_ experiments are performed using the [CamScan X500FE CrystalProbe EBSD-SEM](http://www.gm.univ-montp2.fr/spip.php?article648&lang=en) at Géosciences Montpellier, an Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) system specifically designed to host _in situ_ experiments. Within the EBSD, we use an in-house ceramic stage for the heating experiments and a [MT1000](https://newtec.fr/en/mt-1000/) tensile deformation stage provided by NewTec Scientific for the deformation experiments.

Note that the column of the microscope is tilted 70 degrees to keep the samples horizontal. Upper right, this is the in house ceramic stage (made by Fabrice Barou) used in the annealing experiments. The image was taken during a heating-cooling test with a sample of magnesium alloy AZ31, note the thermocouples attached to different parts of the device. Lower right, the MT1000 deformation stage with a sample in place._

### 2.2 Materials

We use three different materials: magnesium alloy AZ31, ice and olivine.

#### Magnesium

We use commercial-purity AZ31 magnesium alloy (~96% Mg, ~3% Al, ~1% Zn) for the _in situ_ EBSD experiments as we need a material that easily undergoes dynamic or static recrystallization under low-_P_ and moderate _T_ conditions in an SEM-EBSD. Despite being an alloy, magnesium aggregates have been used as rock analogue [before](https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-9201(85)90131-1) since it shares several features with major rock-forming minerals due to its low crystal symmetry (hexagonal):

- highly anisotropic properties
- deform plastically by few slip systems (dominant basal slip system)
- prone to undergo dynamic recrystallization

Furthermore, magnesium alloys have attracted increasing attention in the last two decades due to their low mass density compared to other conventional metallic materials and good mechanical properties, making them candidates for the next generation of light-weight metallic materials.

Note the intense basal texture with a c-axis maxima above 8 multiples of a uniform distribution. The apparent mean grain size is ~9 μm (mode ~5 μm) and most  grains had an internal misorientation spread lower than 1%._

#### Ice (l~h~)

Similar to magnesium, [ice I~h~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ih) is a hexagonal ice crystal with strong anisotropic properties, easy basal slip, and prone to undergo dynamic recrystallization. Knowledge of the rheological properties of ice I~h~ is of great interest for the modelling of the flow of glaciers and polar ice sheets as well as for the understanding of the mechanical behaviour of materials deformed at temperatures close to the material melting point (i.e. as a model material). In our experiments, we used rectangular samples of 10x10x1.5 cm side of polycrystalline columnar ice (i.e. formed of parallel columnar grains with c-axis close to the observation surface) and we generate speckle random patterns on the sample surface to measure plastic strain during deformation using digital image correlation techniques. Samples were deformed in compression using an in house dead-weight rig  at -7 ºC (room pressure) under constant uniaxial stress of 0.5 MPa.

Our main goal with the ice experiments is to understand how strain localise (and/or delocalised) at grain scale, how this phenomenon is affected by local grain interactions, and how the concentration of local deformation relates to the development of dynamic recrystallization. These issues have implications for the modelling of the deformed state of polycrystalline materials at the microstructural scale using continuum mechanics.

Note the recrystallisation at the grain boundaries and the heterogeneous plastic deformation. **Left**: That's me in the cold room making an ice sample with the milling machine._

#### Olivine

Olivine is the main mineral phase in the lithospheric Earth’s mantle and thus a key mineral to understand lithosphere deformation. In the IDEA project, we perform no olivine deformation experiments but we used all the EBSD data-treatment procedures developed within the frame of the project to reanalyse and reinterpret old datasets coming from unpublished olivine deformation experiments. More specifically, we used a dataset that comes from olivine-rich cylinders cored from naturally deformed and undeformed peridotites and deformed in extension in a gas-medium apparatus at a confining pressure of 300 _MPa_ and *T* of 1200ºC. Our main goal is to understand how a common type of dynamic recrystallization, called [sub-grain rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgrain_rotation_recrystallization), develops in olivine and what effects it has on the CPO and the rheology of peridotites.

>**Plain language summary**: We led a series of _in situ_ heating experiments on AZ31 magnesium alloys after deformation under different conditions to demonstrate that the local accumulation of dislocations (a crystallographic defect or irregularity within a crystal structure induced during deformation) controls the growth of new grains free of deformation structures (i.e. static recrystallization).

> **Plain language summary:** The average grain size and the grain size populations are some of the most used features to study the microstructure of rocks and in particular recrystallization. This paper provides  guidelines for determining average grain sizes and the best methods for determining confidence intervals in grain size studies. We concluded that the geometric mean and the confidence intervals for the geometric mean provide the best balance between efficiency and robustness (being the median the best alternative).
